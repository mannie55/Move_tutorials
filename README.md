# Move Language Learning Journal

A personal repository documenting my Move/Sui/Aptos experiments, code snippets, and discoveries.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Repo Is

This is my public learning log where I:
- Post working code examples from my Move practice
- Share mini-lessons learned (with annotations)
- Track progress as I explore Sui/Aptos development

Think of it as a developer's notebook - not polished docs, but raw insights.
